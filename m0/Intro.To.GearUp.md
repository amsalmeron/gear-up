## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?

  The video is a good reminder to rememebr that people a more similar than different and it is important to be concious of potential unfair judgment.

* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?

  Implicit bias is hard because much of it can be unconcious. I choose to approach it by maintaining principles on how I wish to treat people in general, and hold myself accountable to treat everyone equally within those principles. By establishing a plan on how you wish to interact, it enables an expectation and minimizes the potential of implicit bias.

* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?

  I imagine building on software that will impact millions to billions of people and become usefull to their daily lives. Understanding these biases can help  me awknowledge that there are many types of people that will use these product and I have to account for all of them. It is unjust to create software for a select group of people where the others are disadvantaged.


#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort?
